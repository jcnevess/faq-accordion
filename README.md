## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The svg images gave me a very hard time and I might continue studying how to handle them.

I learnt how to use the `details` tag so I can make accordions without using javascript.
